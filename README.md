 # Enigma Balls

Python implementation of the Enigma machine. Named funny because I'm immature.

## Features

- Simulates an Enigma machine.

## Usage
- EnigmaGUI.py can be executed to open a small GUI. If you wanted to use this software via the command line I am sorry. (It can be done and is left as an exercise to the reader)
